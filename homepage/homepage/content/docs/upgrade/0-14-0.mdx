# Jazz 0.14.0 Introducing Zod-based schemas

We're excited to move from our own schema syntax to using Zod v4.

This is the first step in a series of releases to make Jazz more familiar and to make CoValues look more like regular data structures.

**Note: This is a huge release that we're still cleaning up and documenting.**

<small className="leading-tight">
We're still in the process of:
- updating all our docs
- double-checking all our framework bindings
  - particularly React Native might still have issues
- completing all the details of this upgrade guide
</small>

If you see something broken, please let us know on [Discord](https://discord.gg/utDMjHYg42) and check back in a couple hours.

Thanks for your patience!

## Overview:

So far, Jazz has relied on our own idiosyncratic schema definition syntax where you had to extend classes and be careful to use `co.ref` for references.

<CodeGroup>
```ts
// BEFORE
import { co, CoMap, CoList, CoPlainText, ImageDefinition } from "jazz-tools";

export class Message extends CoMap {
  text = co.ref(CoPlainText);
  image = co.optional.ref(ImageDefinition);
  important = co.boolean;
}

export class Chat extends CoList.Of(co.ref(Message)) {}
```
</CodeGroup>

While this had certain ergonomic benefits it relied on unclean hacks to work.

In addition, many of our adopters expressed a preference for avoiding class syntax, and LLMs consistently expected to be able to use Zod.

For this reason, we completely overhauled how you define and use CoValue schemas:

<CodeGroup>
```ts twoslash
// AFTER
import { co, z } from "jazz-tools";

export const Message = co.map({
  text: co.plainText(),
  image: z.optional(co.image()),
  important: z.boolean(),
});

export const Chat = co.list(Message);
```
</CodeGroup>

## Major breaking changes

### Schema definitions

You now define CoValue schemas using two new exports from `jazz-tools`:

- a new `co` definer that mirrors Zod's object/record/array syntax to define CoValue types
  - `co.map()`, `co.record()`, `co.list()`, `co.feed()`
  - `co.account()`, `co.profile()`
  - `co.plainText()`, `co.richText()`,
  - `co.fileStream()`, `co.image()`
  - see the updated [Defining CoValue Schemas](/docs/schemas/covalues)
- `z` re-exported from Zod v4
  - primitives like `z.string()`, `z.number()`, `z.literal()`
    - **note**: additional constraints like `z.min()` and `z.max()` are not yet enforced, we'll add validation in future releases
  - complex types like `z.object()` and `z.array()` to define JSON-like fields without internal collaboration
  - combinators like `z.optional()` and `z.discriminatedUnion()`
    - these also work on CoValue types!
  - see the updated [Docs on Primitive Fields](/docs/schemas/covalues#primitive-fields),
    [Docs on Optional References](/docs/schemas/covalues#optional-references)
    and [Docs on Unions of CoMaps](/docs/schemas/covalues#unions-of-comaps-declaration)

Similar to Zod v4's new object syntax, recursive and mutually recursive types are now [much easier to express](/docs/react/schemas/covalues#recursive-references).
