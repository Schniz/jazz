# Jazz 0.11.0 is out!

Jazz 0.11.0 brings several improvements to the roles and permissions system, making it more powerful and easier to use.

## Breaking Changes

- The `members` method now returns inherited members
- `usePasskeyAuth` now doesn't update `profile.name` if the given username is empty


## New Features

### Enhanced Member Management

The `members` getter now also returns inherited members from parent groups instead of only direct members, providing a more complete view of all users who have access to a resource.

### New Permission Methods

Two new methods have been added to both `Account` and `Group` classes:

- `hasPermissions`: Check if an account or group has specific permissions
- `getRoleOf`: Get the role assigned to a specific member
